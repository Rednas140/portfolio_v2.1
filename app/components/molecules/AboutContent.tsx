            <p>Hey, I'm Sander Verhoeven.</p>
            <p>I strive to make websites that are inclusive for everyone, regardless of their ability or the way that they identify. My core belief is that everyone should work towards making the web inclusive, not because it's forced upon them, but because it's a goal worth pursuing.</p>
            <p>Building websites is passion of mine that extends to both the facets of design and the facets of development. Using these interests, I try to build websites that are fun and intuitive to use for their visitors. </p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio and explore my work thus far!</p>
